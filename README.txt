This project is to make myself a web application 
that allows me to create disposable phone numbers and email addresses so that
I can get in contact with people regardless of what type of service or platform they use.

Creating a web application on your local machine to manage 
disposable phone numbers and email addresses is a substantial 
project that involves several technical components. 


Back-End:
Programming Language: Python - Continue using Python for the back-end.
Web Framework: Flask - Stick with Flask for building the back-end, as it's lightweight and suitable for your use case.
Database: PostgreSQL - Use PostgreSQL as your database for data storage.
Database Library: You'll need a Python library to work with PostgreSQL. The psycopg2 library is commonly used for this purpose.

Front-End:
HTML/CSS: Create a basic user interface using HTML and CSS. Without JavaScript, your interface may be more static, but it can still be functional.

Server Hosting:
Server: Host your application on a server. Platforms like Heroku, which support Flask and PostgreSQL, can be a good choice.

Database Setup:
Database Configuration: Set up your PostgreSQL database, including tables for managing disposable phone numbers and email addresses.

Security:
User Authentication: Implement basic user authentication to access your service.

Anonymity and Privacy: Ensure that your service is designed with privacy and anonymity in mind, as you are the sole user.
- Use an Open-Source Messaging Library:
  - Look for open-source libraries or frameworks that can help me implement messaging features. This will save me time and effort.
- Handle Messaging Logic: Writing code to manage the sending and receiving of messages. Ensure that my messages are encrypted for privacy.
- Generate Temporary Phone Numbers: Researching virtual phone number services that offer APIs or methods to obtain temporary or disposable phone numbers for my use.
- Implement User Authentication: Develop a secure authentication system to protect my messaging system from unauthorized access.
- Prioritize Security: Implement encryption and security best practices to protect my messages and data.
- Documenting my Work: Keep detailed documentation of my code and configurations for future reference.


Python and Go Microservices:
I can use Python for certain components of my messaging system and Go for others
For example, I can use Python for:
- user authentication
- managing the database
- or building a web-based user interface.
Meanwhile, Go can handle messaging server and the core messaging functionality, such as 
- message encryption
- real-time messaging
- and handling network connections; APIs and Communication:

Develop clear APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow the Python and Go components to communicate with each other.
Ensure proper data serialization and deserialization to pass information between the two languages.
Containerization or Orchestration:

Considering containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes if my Python and Go components run in separate containers.

Testing and Debugging:
Be prepared to test and debug both parts of your system separately and together to ensure smooth integration.
Maintainability:

------Here's a simplified step-by-step guide to help me get started:-------

Choose a Technology Stack:
- Will be using Flask for backend development.
- VS code as my editor
- Git and github as my version control

Database Setup:
Setting up a database to store user account information, 
including disposable phone numbers and email addresses. 
- Will be using PostgreSQL

User Registration and Authentication:
Implement a user registration and authentication system. 
Users should be able to create accounts and log in securely.
- Technically I will be the only user 

Generate Disposable Phone Numbers and Email Addresses:
- Will create a functionality to generate and manage disposable phone 
numbers and email addresses.

Messaging Functionality:
- Implementting a messaging system that allows me to send and receive 
messages using the disposable phone numbers and email addresses 
I've generated.

User Interface:
- I will be develop a user-friendly web interface for managing my disposable 
contacts, creating new ones, and sending messages.

Testing:
- Thoroughly test my web application to ensure that it works 
as expected and is secure.

Deployment (Optional):
- I want to access my web application remotely or from 
other devices, so i'll consider deploying it to a server. This would involve hosting, 
domain setup, and security configurations.

Backup and Maintenance:
Regularly back up my data and maintain the application to
address any security vulnerabilities or issues.


----- Messaging Logic ------
Handling messaging logic involves implementing the core functionality of your messaging system. 
This includes the processes that enable users to send and receive messages securely.

Here are some key components you'll need to consider when handling messaging logic:

- User Contacts:
  - I will have the numbers of external contacts saved with the ability to add names to it
- Develop the functionality for users to send text or media messages to each other.
- Implement a notification system to inform users about new messages or other events.
- Decide how message history will be managed and archived, which can be important for user experience.

- Message Delivery Confirmation:
  - I want to implement a mechanism to confirm that messages have been delivered and read by the recipient.
To handle these aspects of messaging logic, I'll likely need a combination of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. 
The specific technologies I use will depend on my project's requirements. 

Some popular choices for messaging systems include:

Flask Python: I can use Python for user authentication, database interactions, and building a web-based user interface.
Go (Golang): Go is well-suited for real-time messaging and handling network communications. Will be used for message encryption, real-time messaging, and server-side logic.
Databases - PostgreSQ: Will eed a database systemL to store user data, contacts, and messages.
Messaging Libraries: Depending on the messaging protocols I choose, I may need libraries to help with message encryption and communication. For example, I can use encryption libraries like OpenPGP or secure messaging protocols like XMPP.
Web Sockets: To enable real-time communication, consider using WebSocket libraries like "github.com/gorilla/websocket" for Go or "websockets" for Python.
Django Python: User Interface Frameworks: To plan to build a web-based user interface for frontend
